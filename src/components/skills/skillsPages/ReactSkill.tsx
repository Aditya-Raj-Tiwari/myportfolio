                            I started learning React in 2019, when I had to code one of my school Project. I was making
                            a homework sharing website for my friends.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>Then I discovered these cool effects I could do with it and made me want to learn it.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>I also recently made this website completely in React.js ! ðŸ˜Š</p>
